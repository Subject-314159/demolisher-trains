demolisher-dummy=This is a trigger technology unlocked by killing a demolisher, which is controlled via scripting. There is no built-in trigger for destroying/killing entities, so a workaround had to be implemented. This technology is NOT unlocked by mining a demolisher's head; though before you can mine it you would have to kill it, so in that case I would say task failed succesfully.
